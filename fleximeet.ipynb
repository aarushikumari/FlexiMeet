            " Good morning, everyone. I'm Arushi Kumari, and I will be talking about ethics in business, featuring technology in the current age. The current day and age seeing a lot of very quick and life-altering developments in all aspects of life. Like it or not, our lives are deeply and generously guided by businesses and every action they take deeply influences our lives. You will think how does a product introduced by a business affect us? Look around you. Every single thing you use has been chosen and selected for you. For something so intricately interwoven into our day-to-day lives, a guiding principle for its functioning becomes important. In the realm of business, ethics serve as a guiding principle and shapes all decision-making processes and behaviors. And we are here to discuss just that, ethics in business. Businesses usually follow two ethical perspectives, deontological and utilitarian perspective. Deontological ethics is rooted in the principles of duty and moral obligation. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to certain rules or principles, regardless of the consequences. From this standpoint, businesses are expected to uphold moral standards and act in accordance with the ethical principles, irrespective of the potential outcomes. The second perspective is utilitarian perspective. This is an exact opposite of the deontological perspective. Utilitarian ethics evaluate actions based on their outcomes, aiming to maximize overall utility or happiness for the greatest number of people. Well, it seems like because we have two perspectives and they are opposite to each other, they seem to have covered a large field. But are they really enough? Technology is picking up very quickly. We are in a time where self-driving cars are real, automation is smoother than ever, and our lives are riddled with human-like bots. But have we ever stopped to examine the ethical implications of these? The integration of AI, self-driving cars, and automation into various industries brings forth a mirage of ethical implications. In the automotive sector, the development of self-driving cars raises questions regarding accountability and liability in the event of accidents or failures. Who bears the responsibility when an autonomous vehicle is involved in a collision? Should the decision-making algorithms prioritize the safety of the passengers or pedestrians in emergency situations?\n"

            " Good morning, everyone. I'm Arushi Kumari, and I will be talking about ethics in business, featuring technology in the current age. The current day and age seeing a lot of very quick and life-altering developments in all aspects of life. Like it or not, our lives are deeply and generously guided by businesses and every action they take deeply influences our lives. You will think how does a product introduced by a business affect us? Look around you. Every single thing you use has been chosen and selected for you. For something so intricately interwoven into our day-to-day lives, a guiding principle for its functioning becomes important. In the realm of business, ethics serve as a guiding principle and shapes all decision-making processes and behaviors. And we are here to discuss just that, ethics in business. Businesses usually follow two ethical perspectives, deontological and utilitarian perspective. Deontological ethics is rooted in the principles of duty and moral obligation. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to certain rules or principles, regardless of the consequences. From this standpoint, businesses are expected to uphold moral standards and act in accordance with the ethical principles, irrespective of the potential outcomes. The second perspective is utilitarian perspective. This is an exact opposite of the deontological perspective. Utilitarian ethics evaluate actions based on their outcomes, aiming to maximize overall utility or happiness for the greatest number of people. Well, it seems like because we have two perspectives and they are opposite to each other, they seem to have covered a large field. But are they really enough? Technology is picking up very quickly. We are in a time where self-driving cars are real, automation is smoother than ever, and our lives are riddled with human-like bots. But have we ever stopped to examine the ethical implications of these? The integration of AI, self-driving cars, and automation into various industries brings forth a mirage of ethical implications. In the automotive sector, the development of self-driving cars raises questions regarding accountability and liability in the event of accidents or failures. Who bears the responsibility when an autonomous vehicle is involved in a collision? Should the decision-making algorithms prioritize the safety of the passengers or pedestrians in emergency situations?\n",
